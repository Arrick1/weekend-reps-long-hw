//var num = 5 where  num would be the definer of the var value of 5 

// What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
//pseudocoding are comment notations that you can do to breakdown the steps of your code

// What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're 
//going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?
